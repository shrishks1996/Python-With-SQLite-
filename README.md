# Python-With-SQLite-
This project aims to use SQLite library, creating a small database file from which data is fetched using other SQL Queries. A chart is also plotted using this data from Matplotlib library.
<br>Database file is made using the connection object.
<br>A Table named SalesDB is created.
<br>List of data is made and stored in a list object, which is then inserted into the database using the insert statement. State of Database is saved using the commit function.
<br>Now, data is fetched from the database using Select statements, based on the where clauses as well.
<br>The output of one of the queries are entered into the Dataframe object df.
<br>A bar plot is also made using the same data of SQL query<br>
